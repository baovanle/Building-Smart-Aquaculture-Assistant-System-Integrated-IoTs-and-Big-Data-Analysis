The development of IoT technology in agriculture, notably aquaculture, has increased over the years due to empowering real-time monitoring and improved environmental sustainability. To ensure the development and survival of aquatic life, farm employees must constantly check and take prompt action to protect the sustainable habitat in ponds. It is also crucial for providing technical assistance to farmers during the growing season. To address these issues, we present the building of a smart aquaculture assistant system integrated with IoT and Big Data.
